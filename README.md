# gol-gui
A Java Swing GUI for Conway's Game of  Life that I wrote as a TA, used as an exercise in COM S 227.
Written in Java 8 to conform with the class's policy.

## Demo:

## Build and run:

The only dependency is Java Swing, and a `hw3.jar` with a working implementation of `Life`.
A student running this GUI to test their code should include `hw3.display.jar` with their project.

Use Eclipse 2019-12 to run the program.
Run `Program.java` to see a basic example.
